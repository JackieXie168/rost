Welcome to the ROST application.

Configure and make the application, and then install the application directory.

The application required that CLICON base and CLICON devel are
installed. If they are not installed in a standard location, the
non-standard location needs to be specified with the --with-clicon=<dir> option.

Example:
# unpack the rost application
> cd rost
> ./configure --with-clicon=/sdk
> make
> ./install.sh
Welcome to ROST application install script.
Enter top application directory: [/usr/local/rost]: /rost
...

Start applications with APPDIR set to application directory (default
is /usr/local/share/clicon).

For example:
> clicon_config -a /usr/local/rost
> clicon_cli -a /rost/local/rost
